# IncomeMonitor Created 18/12/2015

First commit contains part of the core system for income monitor and a pilot
GUI. Much like an accountant, this application will eventually provide a simple 
interface for managing finances at a personal level.

This will calculate income and expenditure providing details on remaining cash
and stats on credit over time to assist in managing finances responsibly.
